## What is Algolem: 
Algolem is a series of algorithms that makes the same thing: Algolem takes two object and create a new ones with another complex structure. 

## Why am i doing that? 
Of course, this repo reppresent just an exercise in style 'cose you can achive same results in a better way using query SQL language.
At the moment i've just implemented Algolem with a for loop series.

Feel free to play with Algolem to better understand the for loops strenght. 
You can test Algolem with react here (https://github.com/EmanueleGurini/algolem).
